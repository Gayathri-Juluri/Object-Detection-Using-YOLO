📷 Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv8 and Webcam
Welcome!
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a webcam and YOLOv8, built with Python, OpenCV, and the Ultralytics library.

🚀 Project Overview
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm.

This project uses YOLOv8 through the Ultralytics library.

It captures live webcam feed, detects multiple objects, and draws bounding boxes around them with labels.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.10+

OpenCV

Ultralytics YOLOv8

Visual Studio Code (IDE)
